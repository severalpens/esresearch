I have the following folders and files in the root of a folder I'm using to run Jupyter files. I'm confused about Puthon environments though. Is the .venv here unnecessary? Does Jupyter store libraries in some global location instead?

Great question! Let's clarify how Python environments and Jupyter work together.

### Virtual Environments (.venv)
The `.venv` directory is a virtual environment that isolates your project's dependencies from the global Python environment. This is useful to avoid conflicts between different projects' dependencies.

### Jupyter and Virtual Environments
Jupyter can use the libraries installed in your virtual environment, but you need to ensure that the Jupyter kernel is set up to use that environment. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Activate your virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Jupyter in your virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

3. **Install the IPython kernel for Jupyter**:
   ```bash
   pip install ipykernel
   ```

4. **Add your virtual environment as a Jupyter kernel**:
   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=your_env_name
   ```

   Replace `your_env_name` with a name you choose for this kernel.

5. **Select the kernel in Jupyter**:
   - Open Jupyter Notebook.
   - Go to `Kernel` > `Change kernel` and select the kernel you just added.

### Global Libraries
By default, Jupyter uses the libraries installed in the environment from which it was launched. If you launch Jupyter from a global Python installation, it will use the global libraries. Using a virtual environment ensures that your project dependencies are isolated and managed correctly.

### Summary
- The `.venv` directory is not unnecessary; it helps manage your project's dependencies.
- Jupyter can use the libraries from your virtual environment if you set up the kernel correctly.
